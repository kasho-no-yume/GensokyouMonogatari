## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Laser emitter magic circle
Laser danmaku SHALL render a pentagram magic circle texture at the beam emitter during the active phase, oriented perpendicular to the beam, expanding and collapsing with the beam thickness envelope, continuously rotating around the beam axis, tinted with the laser entity color using additive blending.

#### Scenario: Circle appears on firing
- **WHEN** laser transitions from delay phase to active phase
- **THEN** a pentagram magic circle renders at the beam emitter (beam start position), facing perpendicular to the beam direction

#### Scenario: Envelope-synchronized expansion and collapse
- **WHEN** the beam thickness envelope expands at fire onset or collapses at beam end
- **THEN** the magic circle scales in sync with the same envelope (full size during stable beam, zero at phase edges)

#### Scenario: Continuous rotation
- **WHEN** the laser remains in active phase
- **THEN** the magic circle rotates continuously around the beam axis at a constant rate

#### Scenario: Color tinting
- **WHEN** laser is spawned with any RGB color
- **THEN** the magic circle renders tinted with the laser entity color using additive blending at full brightness

#### Scenario: No circle during delay phase
- **WHEN** laser is in delay phase
- **THEN** only the semi-transparent red warning indicator line renders; no magic circle appears

### Requirement: Magic circle texture asset
The laser magic circle SHALL use a high-resolution, procedurally drawn (non-pixel-art) texture: white linework pentagram with an outer ring on a transparent background, desaturated so entity color provides all hue.

#### Scenario: Texture quality
- **WHEN** the magic circle texture asset is inspected
- **THEN** it is 256x256 (or higher) with smooth anti-aliased linework (outer ring, inscribed pentagon, pentagram), transparent background, and no baked-in hue
